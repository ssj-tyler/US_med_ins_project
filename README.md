# US_med_ins_project
Open-ended project using US medical insurance data, from November 2022

This project was the culmination of the "Data Science Foundations" coursework from Codecademy, which presented a fairly small (~1350 observations) dataset that detailed various metrics for health - age, sex, BMI, etc. - and a target variable of the person's insurance premium. What we did with this dataset was entirely up to us.

At the time I struggled with this dataset, since I had trouble figuring out what exactly to do with the data and how to answer the question I asked. Going back to it now I was able to much more easily intuit how to compare the different features, and I even used multiple linear regression to build a model that could not only concretely detail which features carried the most weight in increasing or decreasing your premium, but also predict with nearly 80% accuracy what your premium would be. I'm happy that I was able to come back to this project when I had struggled in the past and redeem myself. :)
